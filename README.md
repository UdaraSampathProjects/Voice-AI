<h2>🤖 Voice-to-Voice AI Agent 🧑‍💻</h2>

<p>This project is a real-time voice-based AI agent that enables users to speak directly with the AI and receive instant voice responses. Unlike text-based chatbots, this system provides a more natural, immersive conversation experience, making AI interaction seamless and intuitive. ✨</p>

<h3>📌 Key Features:</h3>

<h4>🎤 Voice Interaction </h4>
<ul>
<li>Speak through a microphone and hear AI respond instantly, providing a dynamic and fluid conversation flow.</li>
</ul>

<h4>⚡ Real-time Communication</h4>
<ul>
<li> Utilizes WebSocket connection to OpenAI's Realtime API to facilitate immediate responses, allowing for smooth and continuous interaction.</li>
</ul>

<h4>🎧 Audio Handling</h4>
<ul>
<li>Captures microphone input and plays AI-generated audio in real-time with PyAudio, ensuring a seamless voice exchange.</li>
</ul>

<h4>🤩 Seamless AI Conversation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Converts user speech into AI queries and AI responses back into voice without any noticeable delay, creating a fluid and responsive conversation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>📌 Impact:</h3>
